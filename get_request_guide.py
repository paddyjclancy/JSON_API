# 1st we need a way to talk HTTP
## we'll use the requests package that is very stable and widely used

# this is a standard py library - no need to install:
# import time

# time.sleep(1)

# requests is not a standard library and must be installed with a package manager
    # package is an external library of code, not native to python (or vanilla python)
    # A package manager, install and manages this package

# python, ruby, javascript, java, C# almost all moderns languages have a package manager.

import requests

# I want to make a get request to get more info on my postcode
# I need to check my API documentation
# then build the target url with path and arguments
#  then I need to use the package request to make the request
# I wil, receive a JSON that I need to parse into a dictionary

#Buil ur
url_target = path + arguments
print(url_target)

#Make request and capture response
